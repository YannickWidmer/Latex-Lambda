certain of \pronouns trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information for the purposes of enabling the other party to evaluate the feasibility of such business relationship and to perform \pronouns obligations and exercise \pronouns rights under any such business relationship that is agreed to between the parties (the "{\bf Purposes}").

The parties have entered into this Agreement in order to assure the confidentiality of such trade secrets and confidential or proprietary information in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  As used in this Agreement, the party disclosing Proprietary Information (as defined below) is referred to as the "{\bf Disclosing Party}"; the party receiving such Proprietary Information is referred to as the "{\bf Recipient}".

\section{Proprietary Information}
As used in this Agreement, the term "{\bf Proprietary Information}" shall mean all trade secrets or confidential or proprietary information designated as such in writing by the Disclosing Party, whether by letter or by the use of an appropriate proprietary stamp or legend, prior to or at the time any such trade secret or confidential or proprietary information is disclosed by the Disclosing Party to the Recipient. Notwithstanding the foregoing, information which is disclosed to the Recipient by the Disclosing Party without an appropriate letter, proprietary stamp or legend, shall constitute Proprietary Information if (i) it would be apparent to a reasonable person, familiar with the Disclosing Party’s business and the industry in which it operates, that such information is of a confidential or proprietary nature the maintenance of which is important to the Disclosing Party or if (ii) the Disclosing Party, within 30 days after such disclosure, delivers to the Recipient a written document or documents describing such Proprietary Information and referencing the place and date of such oral, visual or written disclosure and the names of the Representatives of the Recipient to whom such disclosure was made.

\section{Scope of Agreement}
This Agreement shall apply to all Proprietary Information disclosed between the parties hereto, whether before, on or after the date hereof.

\section{Use and Disclosure of Proprietary Information} \label{sec:discl}
The Recipient \representativesMention{and} shall use the Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party only for the Purposes and such Proprietary Information shall not be used for any other purpose without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. Without limitation of the foregoing, the Recipient shall not cause or permit reverse engineering of any Proprietary Information or decompilation or disassembly of any software programs which are part of the Proprietary Information.
The Recipient \representativesMention{and} shall hold in confidence, and shall not disclose any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party; provided, however, that
\BLOCK{ if isCompany == 'NoNo' }
the Recipient may make any disclosure of such information to which the Disclosing Party gives its prior written consent;
\BLOCK{ else }
(i) the Recipient may make any disclosure of such information to which the Disclosing Party gives its prior written consent; and (ii) any of the Proprietary Information may be disclosed by the \representedParty to its Representatives who need to know such information in connection with the Purposes, or to prospective investors, lenders or acquirors as part of their due diligence investigations, and in each case who are informed of the confidential nature of such information and of the terms of this Agreement. In any event, the \representedParty shall be responsible to the Disclosing Party for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives or such parties, and agrees, at its sole expense, to take reasonable measures to restrain its Representatives and such parties from prohibited or unauthorized disclosure or use of the Proprietary Information.
\BLOCK{ endif }
Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not prohibit the Recipient from disclosing Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent required in order for the Recipient to comply with applicable laws and regulations, provided that the Recipient provides prior written notice of such required disclosure to the Disclosing Party and takes reasonable and lawful actions to avoid and/or minimize the extent of such disclosure.

\section{Limitation on Obligations} \label{sec:limitOblig}
The obligations of the Recipient specified in Section 4 shall not apply, and the Recipient shall have no further obligations, with respect to any Proprietary Information to the extent the Recipient can demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that such Proprietary Information:
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item is generally known to the public at the time of disclosure or becomes generally known without the Recipient \representativesMention{or} violating this Agreement;
\item  is in the Recipient’s possession at the time of disclosure otherwise than as a result of Recipient`s breach of any legal obligation;
\item becomes known to the Recipient through disclosure by sources other than the Disclosing Party without such sources violating any confidentiality obligations to the Disclosing Party; or
\item is independently developed by the Recipient without reference to or reliance upon the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Ownership of Proprietary Information}
The Recipient agrees that it shall not receive any right, title or interest in, or any license or right to use, the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information or any patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property rights therein, by implication or otherwise.
Each of the parties hereto represents, warrants and covenants that the trade secrets which it discloses to the other party pursuant to this Agreement have not been stolen, appropriated, obtained or converted without authorization.

\section{Return of Proprietary Information}
The Recipient shall, upon the written request of the Disclosing Party, return to the Disclosing Party all Proprietary Information received by the Recipient \representativesMention{or} from the Disclosing Party (and all copies and reproductions thereof). In addition, the Recipient shall destroy:  (i) any notes, reports or other documents prepared by the Recipient which contain Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party; and (ii) any Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party (and all copies and reproductions thereof) which is in electronic form or cannot otherwise be returned to the Disclosing Party. Alternatively, upon written request of the Disclosing Party, the Recipient shall destroy all Proprietary Information received by the Recipient {representativesMention}(or) from the Disclosing Party (and all copies and reproduction thereof) and any notes, reports or other documents prepared by the Recipient which contain Proprietary Information of the Disclosing Party. Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Proprietary
Information, the Recipient \representativesMention{and} will continue to be bound by
\VAR{  'his'  if isCompany == 'NoNo' else 'their' }
obligations  of confidentiality and other obligations hereunder.
The Recipient's legal counsel may retain one copy of the Disclosing Party's Proprietary Information for archival purposes only.

\BLOCK{ else }

\BLOCK{ endif }

\section{Miscellaneous}
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
