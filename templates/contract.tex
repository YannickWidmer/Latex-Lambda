that any breach of the provisions of Sections \ref{sec:inventions} \BLOCK{ if isClientCompany } or \ref{sec:solicitation}\ignorespaces \BLOCK{ endif} of this Agreement shall result in serious and irreparable injury to the Client for which the Client cannot be adequately compensated by monetary damages alone.

\VAR{ 'Consultant and its Employees agree,' if isConsultantCompany else 'Consultant agrees,' }
therefore, that, in addition to any other remedy the Consultant may have, the Client shall be entitled to enforce the specific performance of this Agreement by the

All notices required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed effective upon personal delivery or upon deposit in the United States Post Office, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the other party at the address shown above, or at such other address or addresses as either party shall designate to the other in accordance with this Section \ref{sec:notices}.

\section{Pronouns}  Whenever the context may require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular forms of nouns and pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa.

\section{Entire Agreement} This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.

\section{Amendment} This Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both the Client and the Consultant.

\section{Non-Assignability of Contract} This Agreement is personal to the Consultant and the Consultant shall not have the right to assign any of Consultant's rights or delegate any of Consultant's duties without the express written consent of the Client. Any non-consented-to assignment or delegation, whether express or implied or by operation of law, shall be void and shall constitute a breach and a default by the Consultant.

\section{Governing Law} This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction.

\section{Successors and Assigns} This Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, both parties and their respective successors and assigns, including any corporation with which, or into which, the Client may be merged or which may succeed to its assets or business, provided, however, that the obligations of the Consultant are personal and shall not be assigned by Consultant.

\section{Interpretation} If any restriction set forth in Section \ref{sec:inventions} \BLOCK{ if isClientCompany } or Section \ref{sec:solicitation}\ignorespaces \BLOCK{ endif} is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of activities or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable.

\section{Survival} Sections \ref{sec:termination} through \ref{sec:miscellaneous} shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement.

\section{Miscellaneous} \label{sec:miscellaneous}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item No delay or omission by the Client in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that or any other right. A waiver or consent given by the Client on any one occasion shall be effective only in that instance and shall not be construed as a bar or waiver of any right on any other occasion.
    \item The captions of the sections of this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and in no way define, limit or affect the scope or substance of any section of this Agreement.
    \item In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or otherwise unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby.
